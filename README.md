# Airbnb Experiences Clone

This project is a replica of the **Airbnb Experiences** page, built using **React** as part of a learning module from **Scrimba**. The goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate fundamental React concepts such as components, props, state management, and reusable UI elements.

## Project Overview

This project recreates the **Airbnb Experiences** section, where users can browse and explore various experiences. It mimics the UI and layout of Airbnb's page to demonstrate how React can be used to build modular, component-based applications.

The project was built while following a Scrimba learning module, which provided guidance on working with React, creating reusable components, and managing application state.

## Features

- **Component-based architecture**: The app is broken down into reusable components like `Header`, `Card`, `Hero`, and more.
- **Responsive design**: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic content**: Experience data is passed to components using props, making it easy to update and scale.
- **Mocked API data**: Experiences are populated using mock data to simulate fetching from an API.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript syntax for creating and handling components.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for the Airbnb layout.
- **Scrimba**: Online learning platform used for guidance.
